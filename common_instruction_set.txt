calculate root hash:
for each collection,
get a tx,
get all prev values of the tx add to array(includes submitted_on),
get all current_values(each one including the tx hash and id), add to array,
reduce array to hash,
append hash to main collection array,
on completion of a collection, compare value with root hash, exit if no match & no create/delete event happened
else continue to next collection appending collection hash to all array,
on complete, reduce main array to get global root hash and compare as well
